# This is a Flox environment manifest.
# Visit flox.dev/docs/concepts/manifest/
# or see flox-edit(1), manifest.toml(1) for more information.

# List packages you wish to install in your environment inside
# the `[install]` section.

_FLOX_INIT_INSTALL

# Set environment variables in the `[vars]` section. These variables may not
# reference once another, and are added to the environment without first
# expanding them. They are available for use in the `[profile]` and `[hook]`
# scripts.
[vars]
# message = "Howdy"

# The `hook.on-activate` script is run by the *bash* shell immediately upon
# activating an environment, and will not be invoked if Flox detects that the
# environment has previously been activated. Variables set by the script will
# be inherited by `[profile]` scripts defined below. Note that any stdout
# generated by the script will be redirected to stderr.
[hook]
_FLOX_INIT_HOOK

# Scripts defined in the `[profile]` section are *sourced* by *your shell* and
# inherit environment variables set in the `[vars]` section and by `[hook]` scripts.
# The `profile.common` script is sourced by all shells and special care should be
# taken to ensure compatibility with all shells. The `profile.bash` and `profile.zsh`
# scripts are then sourced by the corresponding shell.
[profile]
_FLOX_INIT_PROFILE

# Additional options can be set in the `[options]` section. Refer to
# manifest.toml(1) for a list of available options.
[options]

# An environment that works on one system is guaranteed to work on the same type
# of system, but other systems may not have the same packages available, etc.
# In order to use the environment on a system you must explicitly add it to the
# `options.systems` list.
