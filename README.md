[Flox][website] is a virtual environment and package manager all in one. With Flox you 
create environments that layer and replace dependencies just where
it matters, making them portable across the full software lifecycle.

Install packages from [the biggest open source repository
(nixpkgs)][post-nixpkgs] that contains **more that 80.000 packages**.

With `flox` you can:<br/>

&rarr; [Build container images](https://flox.dev/docs/tutorials/sharing-environments/#sharing-with-containers)<br/>
&rarr; [... and much more][docs]<br/>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

``` text
$ flox init           # <- Create an environment in current directory ‚ú®.

$ flox search hello   # <- Search for a package üöÄ.

$ flox install hello  # <- Install packages into current directory's environment üî®.

$ flox activate       # <- Enter the current directory's environment üéÜ.

flox [my-project] $ hello   # <- Have fun üéâ.
Hello world!

flox [my-project] $ exit    # <- Exit environment üíÉ.
```

## ‚ùì Why

We all build software on top of a dynamic set of tools,
frameworks and packages, allowing us to move quickly and only
build what‚Äôs necessary. However, each new wave of dev tooling
innovation results in an entirely new set of dependencies that
need to be managed. What starts as a simple app or microservice
quickly grows complex, and
turns into a expanding and fragmented supply
chain. Flox brings reproducibility and consistency to complex
software development lifecycles.

## üìò Origins

Flox began its life during the deployment of Nix at
the D. E. Shaw group, where it quickly proved invaluable
by making Nix easier for newcomers and offering centralized
control over packages. As a result, their successful project
became one of the largest, most impactful enterprise deployments
of Nix.
