software distributed by Flox, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. _Definitions_. “**Contribution**” means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or
additions to an existing work, that You intentionally submit to Flox for inclusion in, or documentation
of, any of the products owned or managed by Flox (the “**Work**”). “**Submit**” means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Flox or its representatives, including but not

import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against
You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution,
or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or Work will terminate as of the

waived such rights for Your Contributions to Flox, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA
with Flox;
    b. Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 6 for submissions on behalf
of others); and
    c. Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other

agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on
behalf of a third-party: [named here]”.
7. You agree to notify Flox of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would
make Your representations in this CLA inaccurate in any respect.
