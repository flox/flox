# Flox Test Suite

This test suite is implemented using a framework `bats`, a `bash` like language
which transpiles to `bash` scripts.

Additionally certain tests use `expect` to test interactive usage of the CLI.


## Running the Test Suite

They are located in the `<flox>/tests` folder.
To run them:

```console
$ flox develop flox --command 'cargo build';
$ flox run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./target/debug/flox;
```
By default `flox` CLI is going to be picked from the environment.


When working on the test you would probably want to run them continuously on
every change. In that case run the following:

```console
$ flox develop flox --command 'cargo build';
$ flox run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./target/debug/flox --watch;
```


You can pass arbitrary flags through to `bats` using a `--` separator - however
bugs in the `flox` CLI parser require you to use `sh -c` to wrap the command.
Failing to wrap will cause `flox` to "consume" the `--` rather than pass it
through to the inner command:

```console
$ flox develop flox --command 'cargo build';
$ flox run '.#flox-tests' --                            \
  --flox ./target/debug/flox -- -j 4 ./tests/run.bats;
```


**Important** the option `--tests` must point to the `<flox>/tests/` directory
root which is used to locate various resources within test environments.
If you wish to explicitly name test files to be run, or subdirs of tests, use
`flox-tests ... -- ./tests/foo.bats ./tests/subdir` as show in earlier examples.


## Test Suite Internals

### Setup and Teardown

`bats` recognizes a functions with reserved names to be run when initializing
and cleaning up after test runs.

- `setup_suite` and `teardown_suite`.
  + Run once for a single invocation of `bats` to setup/cleanup all test files.
  + These routines must be defined in the file
    [setup_suite.bash](./setup_suite.bash) which is a reserved filename
    recognized by `bats`.
  + This is the ideal place to define early environment setup such as
    environment variables, authorization tokens, etc.
  + Our `setup_suite` routines are responsible for recording the user's "real"
    environment variables and configs, and then creating a clean runtime
    environment which makes copies or these values in a disposable temporary
    directory prefix.
  + We use this routine to generate `ssh` keys, and launch an agent.
    - This agent is killed during `teardown_suite`.
  + We use this routine to establish a temporary `gitconfig` for both `global`
    and `system` under a temporary prefix.
    - This prevents tests which modify `gitconfig` from modifying a user's real
      configuration files, and prevents contamination between tests.
  + During `teardown_suite` we delete all `flox` environments with the prefix
    `_testing_*` using `flox delete NAME --force --origin`.
    + This is performed by the helper function `deleteAllTestEnvs`.
- `setup_file` and `teardown_file`
  + Run once at the beginning and end of each `NAME.bats` file.
  + Test files may provide their own definitions of these routines, but we
    recommend that you invoke the "common" helper routines `common_file_setup`
    and `common_file_teardown` ( these are the default routines ).
  + These generally create a temporary `FLOX_TEST_HOME` prefix with `XDG_*_HOME`
    and various other config setup.
    - This limits cross contamination between test files, and allows multiple
      test files to be run in parallel.
    - This behavior can be changed so that it is performed for each individual
      test in a file by invoking `common_file_setup test` in `setup_file` and
      adding `home_setup test` to `setup`.
      See [run.bats](./run.bats) for an example.
  + The variable `TEST_ENVIRONMENT` is set based on the current file's basename.
    For example `foo.bats` will yield `TEST_ENVIRONMENT=_testing_foo`.
    - This is performed by [setup_file_envname](./setup_suite.bash).
      + A similar helper `setup_test_envname` may be called in `setup` to
        generate a unique envname for individual tests.
        See [edit.bats](./edit.bats) for an example.
