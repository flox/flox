# Darwin has a "path_helper" which indiscriminately reorders the path to
# put the Apple-preferred items first in the PATH, which completely breaks
# the user's ability to manage their PATH in subshells, e.g. when using tmux.
#
# Trouble is, there's really no way to undo the damage done by the "path_helper"
# apart from inflicting the similarly heinous approach of again reordering the
# PATH to put flox environments at the front. It's fighting fire with fire, but
# unless we want to risk even further breakage by disabling path_helper in
# /etc/zprofile this is the best workaround we've come up with.
