# NAME

flox-push - send environment to FloxHub

# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general-options>] push
     [-d=<path>]
     [-o=<owner>]
     [-f]
```

# DESCRIPTION

Move an environment's manifest to FloxHub or sync local changes to an
environment to FloxHub.

After pushing, the remote environment can be referred to as `<owner>/<name>`.

A path environment contains a manifest file and lock file which are stored
locally and possibly committed to version control.
Pushing the environment moves the manifest and lock file to FloxHub,
leaving a reference to the revision of the environment stored locally.

Once the environment has been pushed, it can be used directly with the
`--remote` option,
or it can be used and edited locally before syncing with `flox push`.
See [`flox-edit(1)`](./flox-edit.md), [`flox-install(1)`](./flox-install.md),
and [`flox-remove(1)`](./flox-remove.md) for editing the environment.

In the same way as a git repo, local changes to an environment that has been
pushed may diverge from the environment on FloxHub if `flox push` is run from a
different host.
Passing `--force` to `flox push` will cause it to overwrite any changes on
FloxHub with local changes to the environment.
