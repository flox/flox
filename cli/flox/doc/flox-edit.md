# NAME

flox-edit - edit the declarative environment configuration

# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general options>] edit
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]
     [[-f=<file>] | -n=<name>]
```

# DESCRIPTION

Transactionally edit the environment manifest.
By default invokes an editor with a copy of the local manifest for the user to
interactively edit.
The editor is found by querying `$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`,
and then by looking for common editors in `$PATH`.
The manifest of an environment on FloxHub or in a different directory
can be edited via the `-r` or `-d` flags respectively.
See [`manifest.toml(1)`](./manifest.toml.md) for more details on the manifest
format.

Once the editor is closed the environment is built in order to validate the
edit.
If the build fails you are given a change to continue editing the manifest,
and if you decline, the edit is discarded.
This transactional editing prevents an edit from leaving the environment in a
broken state.
One exception is the `-n` flag,
which renames a local environment but does not rebuild it.

The environment can be edited non-interactively via the `-f` flag,
which replaces the contents of the manifest with those of the provided file.

    Only works for local environments.
