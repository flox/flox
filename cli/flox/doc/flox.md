where it matters,
making them portable across the full software lifecycle.

These completions are installed alongside Flox.

./include/general-options.md
```

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

`$FLOX_PROMPT_ENVIRONMENTS`
:   Contains a space-delimited list of the active environments,
    e.g. `owner1/foo owner2/bar local_env`.

`$_FLOX_ACTIVE_ENVIRONMENTS`
:   A JSON array containing one object per active environment.
    This is currently an implementation detail
    and its contents are subject to change.

`$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_{1,2}`
:   Flox adds text to the beginning of the shell prompt to indicate which
    environments are active.
    A set of default colors are used to color this prompt,
    but the colors may be overridden with the `$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_1` and
    `$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_2` environment variables.

    The values of these variables should be integers
    chosen from the 256-color palette as described in the
    [xterm-256color chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg).

`$FLOX_DISABLE_METRICS`
:   Variable for disabling the collection/sending of metrics data.
    If set to `true`, prevents Flox from submitting basic metrics information
    such as a unique token and the subcommand issued.

`$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`
:   Override the default editor used for editing environment manifests and commit messages.

`$SSL_CERT_FILE`, `$NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE`
:   If set, overrides the path to the default flox-provided SSL certificate bundle.
    Set `NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE` to only override packages built with Nix,
    and otherwise set `SSL_CERT_FILE` to override the value for all packages.
