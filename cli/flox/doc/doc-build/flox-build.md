# NAME

flox-build - Build packages for Flox


# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general-options>] build
     [-d=<path>]
     [-L]
     [<package>]...
```

# DESCRIPTION

Build the specified `<package>` from the environment in `<path>`,
and output build artifacts at `result-<package>` adjacent to the environment.

## Manifest defined Packages

Possible values for `<package>` are all keys under the `build` attribute
in the `manifest.toml`.
If no `<package>` is specified, Flox will attempt to build all packages
that are defined in the environment.

Packages are built by running the script defined in `build.<package>.command`
within a `bash` subshell.
The shell will behave as if `flox activate` was run
immediately prior to running the build script.

By default, builds are run in a sandbox.
For a sandboxed build, the current project is _copied_ into a sandbox directory.
To avoid copying excessive files, e.g. accumulating build artifacts from earlier
manual builds, `.env` files containing secrets etc.,
only files tracked by `git` are available.
Untracked files, files outside of the repository and notably network access
will be restricted to encourage "pure" and reproducible builds.
Builds can opt out of the sandbox by setting `build.<package>.sandbox = "off"`.
With the sandbox disabled, building is equivalent
to running the build script manually within a shell created by `flox activate`.
Any build can access the _results_ of other builds
(including non-sandboxed ones) by referring to their name via `${<package>}`.
In the example below, the `app` package depends on the `dep` package
by using `${deps}/node_modules`.

`flox build` creates a temporary directory for the build script
to output build artifacts to.
The environment variable `out` is set to this directory,
and the build script is expected to copy or move artifacts to `$out`.

Upon conclusion of the build, the build result
will be symlinked to `result-<package>` adjacent to the `.flox` directory
that defines the package.


# OPTIONS

`-L`, `--build-logs`
:   Enable detailed logging emitted by the build scripts.
    **not implemented yet**

`<package>`
:   The package(s) to build.
    Possible values are all keys under the `build` attribute
    in the environment's `manifest.toml`.


```{.include}
./include/environment-options.md
./include/general-options.md
```

# EXAMPLES

`flox build` is an experimental feature.
To use it the `build` feature flag has to be enabled:

```shell
$ flox config --set features.build true
# OR
$ export FLOX_FEATURES_BUILD=true
```

## Building a simple pure package

1. Add build instructions to the manifest:

```toml
# file: .flox/env/manifest.toml

...
[build]
hello.command = '''
# produce something and move it to $out
mkdir -p $out
echo "hello world" >> $out/hello.txt
'''
```

2. Build the package and verify its contents:

```
$ flox build hello
$ ls ./result-hello
hello.txt
$ cat ./result-hello/hello.txt
hello, world
```

## Building a simple multi-stage app

Assume a simple `nodejs` project

```
.
├── .git/
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public/
├── README.md
├── src/
...
```

1. Initialize a Flox environment

```shell
$ flox init
```

2. Install dependencies and add build instructions

```toml
# file: .flox/env/manifest.toml
version = 1

[install]
nodejs.pkg-path = "nodejs"
rsync.pkg-path = "rsync"

# install node dependencies using npm
# disable the sandbox to allow access to the network
[build]
deps.command = '''
npm ci
mkdir -p $out
mv node_modules $out/node_modules
'''
deps.sandbox = "off"

# build the application using previously fetched dependencies
app.command = '''
rsync -lr ${deps}/node_modules ./
npm run build
mv dist $out/
'''
```

3. Verify the result

```shell
$ npx serve result-app
```
