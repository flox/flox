# NAME

flox-activate - activate environments

# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general-options>] activate
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner>/<name>]
     [-t]
     [--print-script]
     [ -- <command> [<arguments>]]
```

# DESCRIPTION

Sets environment variables and aliases, runs hooks,
and adds `bin` directories to your `$PATH`.

`flox activate` may run in one of three modes:

* interactive: `flox activate` when invoked from an interactive shell
  Launches an interactive sub-shell.
  The shell to be launched is determined by `$FLOX_SHELL` or `$SHELL`.
* command: `flox activate -- CMD`
  Executes `CMD` in the same environment as if run inside an interactive shell
  produced by an interactive `flox activate`
  The shell `CMD` is run by is determined by `$FLOX_SHELL` or `$SHELL`.
* in-place: `flox activate` when invoked from an non-interactive shell
  with it's `stdout` redirected e.g. `eval "$(flox activate)"`
  Produces commands to be sourced by the parent shell.
  Flox will determine the parent shell from `$FLOX_SHELL` or otherwise
  automatically determine the parent shell and fall back to `$SHELL`.

`flox activate` currently only supports `bash` and `zsh` shells
for any of the detection mechanisms described above.

When invoked interactively,
the shell prompt will be modified to display the active environments,
as shown below:
```
flox [env1 env2 env3] <normal prompt>
```

When multiple environments are activated each of their shell hooks
(`profile` and `hook` scripts)
are executed in the context of the environment that they come from.
This means that for each shell hook various environment variables such as
`PATH`, `MANPATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, etc,
are set to the appropriate values for the environment in which the shell
hook was defined.
See [`manifest.toml(1)`](./manifest.toml.md) for more details on shell hooks.

# OPTIONS

## Activate Options

`-- <command> [<arguments>]`
:   Command to run in the environment.
    Spawns the command in a subshell that does not leak into the calling
    process.

`-t`, `--trust`
:   Trust a remote environment for this activation.
    Activating an environment executes a shell hook which may execute arbitrary
    code.
    This presents a security risk,
    so you will be prompted whether to trust the environment.
    Environments owned by the current user and Flox are always trusted.
    You may set certain environments to always be trusted using the config key
    `trusted_environments."<owner/name>" = (trust | deny)`,
    or via the following command:
    `flox config --set trusted_environments.\"<owner/name>\" trust`.

`--print-script`
:  Prints an activation script to `stdout` that's suitable for sourcing in
   a shell rather than activation via creating a subshell.
   `flox` automatically knows when to print the activation script to `stdout`,
   so this command is just a debugging aid for users.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

## Variables set by `flox activate`

`$FLOX_PROMPT_ENVIRONMENTS`
:   Contains a space-delimited list of the active environments,
    e.g. `owner1/foo owner2/bar local_env`.
    This is set to an _empty string_ if the config value for `shell_prompt`
    is `hide-all` or `hide-default` and only environments named 'default'
    are active.

`$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`
:   `activate` sets this variable to a directory that can be used by an
    environment's hook to store transient files.
    These files will persist for environments used locally,
    but they will not be pushed,
    and they will not persist when using a remote environment with `-r`.

`$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT`
:   `activate` sets this variable to the directory of the project using the flox
    environment.
    For environments stored locally, this is the directory containing the
    environment.
    When running `flox activate -r`, this is set to the current working
    directory.
    This variable can be used to find project files in environment hooks.

`$_FLOX_ACTIVE_ENVIRONMENTS`
:   A JSON array containing one object per active environment.
    This is currently an implementation detail
    and its contents are subject to change.

## Variables used by `flox activate`

`$FLOX_SHELL`
:  When launching an interactive sub-shell, Flox launches the shell specified in
   `$FLOX_SHELL` if it is set.
   When printing a shell for sourcing in the current shell,
   Flox will produce a script suitable for `$FLOX_SHELL` if it is set.

`$SHELL`
:  When launching an interactive sub-shell, Flox launches the shell specified in
   `$SHELL` if it is set and `$FLOX_SHELL` is not set.
   When printing a shell for sourcing in the current shell,
   Flox will produce a script suitable for `$SHELL` if it is set
   and `$FLOX_SHELL` is not set and Flox can't detect the parent shell.

`$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_{1,2}`
:   Flox adds text to the beginning of the shell prompt to indicate which
    environments are active.
    A set of default colors are used to color this prompt,
    but the colors may be overridden with the `$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_1` and
    `$FLOX_PROMPT_COLOR_2` environment variables.

    The values of these variables should be integers
    chosen from the 256-color palette as described in the
    [xterm-256color chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg).

# EXAMPLES:

Activate an environment stored in the current directory:

```
$ flox activate
```

Activate an environment `some_user/myenv` that's been pushed to FloxHub:

```
$ flox activate -r some_user/myenv
```

Invoke a command inside an environment without entering its subshell:

```
$ flox activate -- cmd --some-arg arg1 arg2
```

Activate `default` Flox environment only within the current shell
(add to the relevant "rc" file, e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zprofile`):

```
$ eval "$(flox activate)"
```
