# NAME

flox-upgrade - upgrade packages in an environment

# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general-options>] upgrade
     [-d=<path> | -r=<owner>/<name>]
     [<package or pkg-group>]...
```

# DESCRIPTION

Upgrade packages in an environment to versions present in the environment's base
catalog.

An upgrade should usually be run after updating an environment's base catalog with
[`flox-update(1)`](./flox-update.md).

When no arguments are specified, all packages in the environment are upgraded.

Packages to upgrade can be specified by either pkg-group name,
or, if a package is not in a pkg-group with any other packages,
it may be specified by ID.
If the specified argument is both a pkg-group name and a package ID,
the pkg-group is upgraded.

Packages without a specified pkg-group in the manifest are placed in a
pkg-group named 'toplevel'.
The packages in that pkg-group can be upgraded without updating any other
pkg-groups by passing 'toplevel' as the pkg-group name.

See [`manifest.toml(1)`](./manifest.toml.md) for more on using pkg-groups.
