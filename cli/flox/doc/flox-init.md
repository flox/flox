# NAME

flox-init - initialize a Flox environment

# SYNOPSIS

```
flox [<general-options>] init
     [-n <name>]
     [-d <path>]
```

# DESCRIPTION

Create a new empty environment in the current directory.

The name of the environment will be the basename of the current directory
or `default` if the current directory is `$HOME`.
The `--name` flag can be used to give the environment a specific name.

By default the environment will be created in the current directory.
Flox will add a directory `$PWD/.flox` containing all relevant environment 
metadata.
The `--dir` flag can be used to create an environment in another location.

If an environment already exists in the current directory,
or the path specified using `--dir` exists,
an error is returned.
