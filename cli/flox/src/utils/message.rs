/// A history for messages printed to stderr through the `message` module .
/// In unit tests, the messaging functions of the `message` module will,
/// populate a `History` in addition to printing the message to stderr.
/// This allows the test to assert against the messages printed to stderr,
/// without refactoring existing implementations to print to a `Write` trait
/// and injecting a mock in tests.
///
/// The `History` is thus comparitivly non-intrusive.
/// However, it comes with a few caveats:
///
/// Messaging functions are currently effectively (process) globals,
/// inheriting the global nature of `stderr`.
/// `#[test]` functions are run in parallel on separate _threads_
/// by both `cargo test` and `cargo nextest`.
/// Assuming an equally global `History`, messages from one test
/// will be visible in another test.
/// There are several approaches to avoid this:
///
/// * running tests in sequence (e.g. `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`),
///   slows down the test suite.
/// * additional bookkeeping of scopes (e.g. via `tracing`),
///   complicates the test setup, wither needs to be done manually,
///   or we maintain a `#[test]` replacement. (That said,
///   there may be something to learn from `tracing`s architecture).
/// * Pass a `History` instance to the messaging functions,
///   intrusive as it reqeuries all callers to be updated.
/// * Use a [thread_local!] `History`, which is the current approach.
///
/// Being thread local, the `History` is not shared between threads,
/// i.e. not shared between tests.
/// On the flip side, if the test spawns additional threads,
/// which print messages, these will be captured in the `History`
/// of the thread that spawned them, rather than the test's `History`.
/// Likewise if the test uses a multi-threaded async runtime, like `tokio`,
/// messages from spawned tasks will not be captured in the `History`.
/// Also due to runtimes sharing threads between tasks, the `History` available
/// in the task is also shared between tasks.
///
/// Luckily, our CLI surface is largely single threaded.
/// Threads are mainly spawned for blocking operations either in the library layer,
/// or to run library functions in the background, e.g. to print a progress bar
/// on the main thread.
/// Also, while technically within an async runtime, the CLI is largely synchronous,
/// and the default [#[tokio::test]] runtime is single threaded.
