/// As root we understand file system based abstractions in flox,

///
/// Examples are
/// - flox managed projects
/// - floxmeta repositories
/// - environments
///
/// All of them have certain requirements that shold be provided.
/// Examples include:
/// - must exist, locally
/// - must be a git repo
/// - must be a flake
/// - and more
///
/// Each of these requirements can be modeled as a typestate.
/// By walking those typestates, we can gradually guarantee more requirements.
///
/// A root that is missing some requirements is usually modeled as [`Root<Closed<_>>`].
/// An implementation for [`Root<Closed<_>>`] defines how to "upgrade" the root
/// into a stronger state.
/// This is done by providing methods which map the current state into a [`Guard<New, Old>`].
