# EXAMPLES

## Running applications in the current working directory

If `flox run` is called without any arguments, and a controlling tty is available,
it will offer the user a selection of installable from the current flake.
Note, in this example, it's assumed there's a `flake.nix` in the current directory path.

```console
$ flox run
? Select a packageapp for flox run  
> flox
  flox-bash
  nix-editor
[â†‘ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

If `flox run` is called with an argument, it will try to run that installable instead, without asking for user input.
Note, in this example, it's assumed there's a `flake.nix` in the current directory.

```
$ flox run flox -- -- --version
```

## Running applications from nixpkgs

It is possible to use `flox run`, to run packages from nixpkgs as follows.

```console
$ flox run 'nixpkgs#cowsay' -- 'Moo'
```

## Passing flags

Flags can be passed to the called installable as follows.

```console
$ flox run 'nixpkgs#cowsay' -- -- --help
```
