# Flox CLI and Library

## Contents of the Repo

Currently this repo houses three rust crates:

- `flox`: the flox binary and reimplementation of the `bash` based flox.
- `flox-rust-sdk`: A library layer implementing flox's capabilities independent
  of the frontend.
- `floxd`: a potential flox daemon

## Development

```
$ flox develop .#rust-env
```

> **Note**
>
> If you have access to internal repositories, instead run
>
> ```
> $ flox develop .#rust-env --override-input flox-bash github:flox/flox-bash-private
> ```
>
> to work with the prerelease version of flox.

This sets up an environment with dependencies, rust toolchain, variable
and pre-commit-hooks.

In the environment, use [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
to build the rust based cli.

- build and run flox
   ```
   $ cargo run -- <args>
   ```
- build a debug build of flox
   ```
   $ cargo build
   # builds to ./target/debug/flox
   ```
- build an optimized release build of flox
   ```
   $ cargo build --release
   # builds to ./target/release/flox
   ```

**Note:**

cargo based builds should only be used locally.
Flox must be buildable using `flox` or `nix`.

- format rust code:
  ```
  $ cargo fmt
  $ cargo fmt --check # just check
  ```
  The project is formatted using rustfmt and applies custom rules through
  `.rustfmt.toml`.
  A pre-commit hook is set up to check rust file formatting.
- format nix code
  ```
  $ alejandra .
  $ alejandra . --check # just check
  ```
  A pre-commit hook is set up to check nix file formatting.
- lint rust
  ```
  $ cargo clippy --all
  ```
- lint all files (including for formatting):
  ```
  $ pre-commit run -a
  ```

## Git

### CLA

- [ ] All commits in a Pull Request are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and Verified by Github or via GPG.
- [ ] As an outside contributor you need to accept the flox [Contributor License Agreement](.github/CLA.md) by adding your Git/Github details in a row at the end of the [`CONTRIBUTORS.csv`](.github/CONTRIBUTORS.csv) file by way of the same pull request or one done previously.

### Commits

This project follows (tries to),
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

We employ [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)
to help enforcing those rules.

**Commit messages that explain the content of the commit are appreciated**

-----

For starters: commit messages shold have to follow the pattern:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements,
to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. **fix**: a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase
   (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
2. **feat**: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
   (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:,
   or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change
   (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning).
   A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed,
   for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)
   recommends `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`,
   `test`, and others.
5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided
   and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification,
and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning
(unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).

A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type,
to provide additional contextual information
and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse
arrays.

-----

A pre-commit hook will ensure only correctly formatted commit messages are
committed.

You can also run

```
$ cz c
```

or

```
$ cz commit
```

to make conforming commits interactively.

### Merges

This repo follows a variant of [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Features are branched off the `develop` branch and committed back to it,
upon completion, using GitHub PRs.
Features should be **squashed and merged** into `develop`,
or if they represent multiple bigger changes,
squashed into multiple distinct change sets.

### Releases

**TODO**



## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit test are ran with `cargo`:

```console
$ flox develop flox --command "cargo test"
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests are written with `bats` and `expect`.
They are located in the `./tests` folder.
To run them:

```console
$ cargo build
$ flox run .#flox-tests --flox ./target/debug/flox
```
By default `flox` CLI is going to be picked from the environment.

When working on the test you would probably want to run them continuously on
every change. In that case run the following:

```console
$ flox run .#flox-tests --flox ./target/debug/flox --watch
```

Also note that you can pass `bats` arguments, like `--filter`, to not run all
the tests.

```console
$ flox run .#flox-tests --flox ./target/debug/flox --watch -- --filter "flox search"
```
