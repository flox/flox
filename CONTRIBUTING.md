# Flox CLI and Library

## Quick Start
```console
$ cd git clone git@github.com/flox/flox.git;
$ cd flox;
# Enter Dev Shell
$ nix develop;
# Build `pkgdb', `env-builder', and `flox'
$ just build;
# Run the build
$ ./cli/target/debug/flox --help;
# Run the test suite ( requires `./tests/debug/flox' )
$ nix run '.#flox-tests';
```

## Contents of the Repo

Currently this repo houses three rust crates:

- `flox`: the flox binary and reimplementation of the `bash` based flox.
- `flox-rust-sdk`: A library layer implementing flox's capabilities independent
  of the frontend.
- `floxd`: a potential flox daemon

## Development

```console
$ nix develop;
```

This sets up an environment with dependencies, rust toolchain, variable
and `pre-commit-hooks`.

In the environment, use [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
to build the rust based cli.

**Note:**

cargo based builds should only be used locally.
Flox must be buildable using `flox` or `nix`.

### Build and Run `flox`

- build and run flox
   ```console
   $ pushd cli;
   $ cargo run -- <args>;
   ```
- build a debug build of flox
   ```console
   $ just build;
   # builds to ./cli/target/debug/flox
   ```
- run flox unit tests
   ```console
   $ pushd cli;
   $ cargo test [<args>]
   # or enable impure and other long running tests with
   $ cargo -F extra-tests [<args>]
   ```
- build an optimized release build of flox
   ```console
   $ make -C pkgdb -j;
   $ make -C env-builder -j;
   $ ( pushd cli||return; cargo build --release; )
   # builds to ./cli/target/release/flox
   ```

### Lint and Format `flox`

- format rust code:
  ```console
  $ pushd cli;
  $ cargo fmt
  $ cargo fmt --check # just check
  ```
  The project is formatted using rustfmt and applies custom rules through
  `.rustfmt.toml`.
  A pre-commit hook is set up to check rust file formatting.
- format nix code
  ```console
  $ alejandra .
  $ alejandra . --check # just check
  ```
  A pre-commit hook is set up to check nix file formatting.
- lint rust
  ```console
  $ pushd cli;
  $ cargo clippy --all
  ```
- lint all files (including for formatting):
  ```console
  $ pre-commit run -a
  ```

### Setting up rust IDE support

- Install the `rust-analyzer` plugin for your editor
   - See the [official installation instruction](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation)
     (in the `nix develop` subshell the toolchain will aready be provided, you can skip right to your editor of choice)
- If you prefer to open your editor at the project root, you'll need to help rust-analyzer find the rust workspace by configuing the`linkedProjects` for `rust-analyzer`.
   In VS Code you can add this: to you `.vscode/settings.json`:
   ```json
   "rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
      "${workspaceFolder}/cli/Cargo.toml"
   ]
   ```
- If you want to be able to run and get analytics on impure tests, you need to activate the `extra-tests` feature
   In VS Code you can add this: to you `.vscode/settings.json`:
   ```json
   "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
      "extra-tests"
   ]
   ```

## Git

### CLA

- [ ] All commits in a Pull Request are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and Verified by Github or via GPG.
- [ ] As an outside contributor you need to accept the flox [Contributor License Agreement](.github/CLA.md) by adding your Git/Github details in a row at the end of the [`CONTRIBUTORS.csv`](.github/CONTRIBUTORS.csv) file by way of the same pull request or one done previously.

### Commits

This project follows (tries to),
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

We employ [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)
to help enforcing those rules.

**Commit messages that explain the content of the commit are appreciated**

-----

For starters: commit messages shold have to follow the pattern:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements,
to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. **fix**: a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase
   (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
2. **feat**: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
   (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:,
   or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change
   (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning).
   A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed,
   for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)
   recommends `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`,
   `test`, and others.
5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided
   and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification,
and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning
(unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).

A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type,
to provide additional contextual information
and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse
arrays.

-----

A pre-commit hook will ensure only correctly formatted commit messages are
committed.

You can also run

```console
$ cz c
```

or

```console
$ cz commit
```

to make conforming commits interactively.

### Merges

This repo follows a variant of [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Features are branched off the `develop` branch and committed back to it,
upon completion, using GitHub PRs.
Features should be **squashed and merged** into `develop`,
or if they represent multiple bigger changes,
squashed into multiple distinct change sets.

### Releases

**TODO**



## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit test are ran with `cargo`.
These cover code authored in Rust, but does not explicitly cover code authored
in `<flox>/flox-bash/`.

```console
$ nix develop --command 'just test';
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests are written with `bats` and `expect`.
They are located in the `<flox>/tests` folder.
To run them:

```console
$ nix develop --command 'just build';
$ nix run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./cli/target/debug/flox;
```
The second `--` separates the `nix run` arguments from arguments supplied to the `flox-tests` script defined in `pkgs/flox-tests/default.nix`.
The `--flox` flag specifies which `flox` executable to use as by default `flox` will be picked from the environment.
A third `--` can be used to pass arguments to `bats`.

**Important** the `flox-tests` option `--tests` must point to the `<flox>/tests/` directory
root which is used to locate various resources within test environments.

#### Continuous testing
When working on the test you would probably want to run them continuously on
every change. In that case run the following:

```console
$ nix develop --command 'just build';
$ nix run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./cli/target/debug/flox --watch;
```

#### `bats` arguments
You can pass arbitrary flags through to `bats` using the third `--` separator - however
bugs in the `flox` CLI parser require you to use `sh -c` to wrap the command.
Failing to wrap will cause `flox` to "consume" the `--` rather than pass it
through to the inner command:

```console
$ nix develop --command 'just build';
$ nix run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./cli/target/debug/flox -- -j 4;
```
This example tells `bats` to run 4 jobs in parallel.

#### Running subsets of tests
You can specify which tests to run by passing arguments to either `flox-tests` or by directly passing arguments to `bats`.

##### Running a specific file
In order to run a specific test file, pass the path to the file to `flox-tests`:
```console
$ nix run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./cli/target/debug/flox ./tests/run.bats;
$ or, using the Justfile
$ just bats-file ./tests/run.bats
```
This example will only run tests in the `tests/run.bats` file.


##### Running tagged tests
When writing integration tests it's important to add tags to each test to identify which subsystems the integration test is using.
This makes it easier to target a test run at the subsystem you're working on.

You add tags to a test with a special comment:
```
# bats test_tags=foo,bar,baz
@test "this is the name of my test" {
   run "$FLOX_BIN" --help;
   assert_success;
}
```

You can apply a tag to tests in a file with another special comment, which applies the tags to all of the tests that come after the comment:
```
# bats file_tags=foo

@test "this is the name of my test" {
   run "$FLOX_BIN" --help;
   assert_success;
}


@test "this is the name of my test" {
   run "$FLOX_BIN" --help;
   assert_success;
}
```

Tags cannot contain whitespace, but may contain `-`, `_`, and `:`, where `:` is used for namespacing.

The list of tags to use for integration tests is as follows:
- `init`
- `build_env`
- `install`
- `uninstall`
- `activate`
- `push`
- `pull`
- `search`
- `edit`
- `list`
- `delete`
- `upgrade`
- `project_env`
- `managed_env`
- `remote_env`

Some of these tags will overlap. For example, the `build_env` tag should be used any time an environment is built, so there is overlap with `install`, `activate`, etc.

In order to run tests with a specific tag, you'll pass the `--filter-tags` option to `bats`:
```console
$ nix run '.#flox-tests' -- --flox ./cli/target/debug/flox  \
                         -- --filter-tags activate;
$ # or, using the Justfile
$ just bats-tests --filter-tags activate
```
This example will only run tests tagged with `activate`.
You can use boolean logic and specify the flag multiple times to run specific subsets of tests.
See the [bats usage documentation](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html) for details.
