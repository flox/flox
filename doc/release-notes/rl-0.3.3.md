## Release 0.3.3 (2023-09-05)

This release addresses a security-related issue and minor bug introduced with the recent 0.3.0 release, namely:
- Restored secure token storage for logging into the flox CLI. ([PR#255](https://github.com/flox/flox/pull/255))
- Fixed minor bug with `flox --version` to ensure all remaining arguments (if any) are valid.

We especially want to thank all our github.com/flox/flox contributors and discourse community members for all your valuable feedback!
