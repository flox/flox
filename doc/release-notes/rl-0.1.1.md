## Release 0.1.1 (2023-03-08)

This release includes several performance improvements, bug fixes, and feature refinements based on feedback since our Feb 7 release (0.1.0).

Specifically, this release includes:
- added support for `flox generations --json`
- improved package name resolution in the output of `flox list`
- fixed `flox search --json`
- ported multiple functions from bash MVP to rust rewrite
- updated channel subscriptions to span multiple machines
- the parsing of `gh` subcommand args has been fixed
- updated flox/flox/README
- minor updates to help and man pages and numerous bug fixes
