## Release 0.1.1 (2023-03-08)

This release includes several performance improvements, bug fixes, and feature refinements based on feedback since our Feb 7 release (0.1.0).

Specifically, this release includes:
- added support for `flox generations --json`

- fixed `flox search --json`
- ported multiple functions from bash MVP to rust rewrite
- updated channel subscriptions to span multiple machines
- the parsing of gh subcommand args has been fixed
