## Release 0.3.4 (2023-09-28)

This release addresses several bugs and improvements, including:
- Fixed bugs affecting flox (activate|containerize|publish).
- Fixed bug affecting output from --verbose.
- Worked on changes in the background to the flox CLI as we aim for our general availability (1.0) release.

We especially want to thank all our github.com/flox/flox contributors and discourse community members for all your valuable feedback!
