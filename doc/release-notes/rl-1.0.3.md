## Release 1.0.3 (2024-04-09)

This release addresses several bugs and adds new improvements, including:

 - Search output now shows **bold** search term hits in `flox search`.
 - Fixed a bug that could cause Flox to hang.
 - `flox pull --force` will now overwrite any existing `.flox`
 - Omit the "Version:" prefix when printing version.

We especially want to thank all our github.com/flox/flox contributors and
[slack community members](https://go.flox.dev/slack) for all your valuable feedback!
