# We can't do much about that, but we can try to fight back

# *iff* there is a `/usr/libexec/path_helper`.
# In that case, the existing PATH is patched to move the flox environment paths
# to the front.
# The PATH items corresponding to the current activation
# are subsequently prepended to the patched path as usual.

# Set the man(1) search path.
# The search path for manual pages is determined
# from the MANPATH environment variable in a non-standard way:
#
# 1) If MANPATH begins with a colon, it is appended to the default list;
# 2) if it ends with a colon, it is prepended to the default list;
# 3) or if it contains two adjacent colons,
#    the standard search path is inserted between the colons.
# 4) If none of these conditions are met, it overrides the standard search path.
#
# In order for man(1) to find manual pages not definded in the flox environment,
# we ensure that we prepend the flox search path _with_ a colon in all cases.
#
# Thus, the man pages defined in the flox environment are searched first,
# and default search paths still apply.
# Additionally, decisions made by the user by setting the MANPATH variable
# are not overridden by the flox environment:
# - If MANPATH starts with `:` we now have `::` -> rule 1/3,
#   the defaults are inserted in between,
#   i.e. in front of MANPATH, but FLOXENV will take precedence in any case
# - If MANPATH ends with `:` we end with `:` -> rule 2,
#   the defaults are appended (no change)
# - If MANPATH does not start or end with `:`, -> rule 4,
#   FLOX_ENV:MANPATH replaces the defaults (no change)
